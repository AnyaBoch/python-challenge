Module 3 home assignment for PyBank and PyPoll

**_PyBank difficulties:_**
I struggles a lot and this homework assignment was difficult. I needed help of a tutor cause I neede more explanation for calculations, sequence, and coding methods. The tutor provided the work as a sample. My problem was easily solved in Excel, but here it turned out to be quite a challenging task. I was working on PyBank using conditions such as: 
**if previous_value is not None**: and **if previous_profit != ""**, which ChatGPT suggested. However, the code only worked when the conditions started as **if total_months > 1**."link for this work: https://pastebin.com/cKGk0UZd

**PyBank Instructions**
In this Challenge, I am tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of some company. I was given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

My analysis should be aligned with the following results:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
